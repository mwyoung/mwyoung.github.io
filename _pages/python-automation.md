One easy way to learn more about python is the book [Automate the Boring Stuff with
Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart, which is also available in a
lecture series on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/).

The first part of the course is helpful with learning some of the syntax of Python such as
if/while/for, functions, try/except, lists, dictionaries, and strings. The second part of
the course goes into files, debugging, and using 3rd party modules for web scraping,
excel, word and PDF documents, email, and GUI automation.
