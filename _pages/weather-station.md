### Cost per year
Using a P3 P4400 [Kill A
Watt](https://www.amazon.com/P3-P4400-Electricity-Usage-Monitor/dp/B00009MDBU) meter, the
power was measured to be about 0.8W when the display is active, 1.0W when getting data,
and 0.4W when off. The same current was found to be about 80mA when getting data.

For overall cost, at the average energy rate of [13.19 cents/kWh (as of Aug
2019)](https://web.archive.org/web/20191020031839/https://www.electricchoice.com/electricity-prices-by-state/)
over a year (365 day \* 24 hours = 8760 hours) would be about (1.0W * 8760 hours)/1000 \*
13.19 cents = $1.16.
