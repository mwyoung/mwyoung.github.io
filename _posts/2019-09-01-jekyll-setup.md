---

This Jekyll setup used several guides, including
[Archwiki - ruby setup](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ruby),
[jmcglone - overall setup](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/),
[jekyllrb - post setup](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/08-blogging/),
[SO - Google Webcrawler](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10376009/how-send-to-google-ping-after-add-new-post/13989836#13989836),
[Medium - CSS Footer](https://medium.com/@paynoattn/flexbox-sticky-footer-d19dab50c34),
for a Ubuntu based machine to test before deploying to Github Pages.

For Ruby, a local install option was used.

Note: there needs to be enough content for Google to actually crawl the website, along
with taking some time to do so. The sitemap for this website is located
[here](/sitemap.xml).
