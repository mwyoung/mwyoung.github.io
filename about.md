This website is to keep information that was useful to me so I have a place to reference
it, and to show some of the projects I have been working on.

This website also uses posts sorted by date updated, and has a static set of pages instead
of a blog with individual days used for each post.

Example projects:<br />
[Weather Station](https://github.com/mwyoung/Weather-Station)<br />
[Avr Serial Setup](https://github.com/mwyoung/avr-serial-test)<br />
[PCB Ruler](https://github.com/mwyoung/Adafruit-PCB-Ruler)<br />
[LED Cube](https://github.com/mwyoung/LED-Cube)<br />
