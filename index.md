This is a personal website for sharing [projects]({% link pages.html %}) and providing a
source to remember where to find information.

This website was built using [jekyll]({% link _pages/jekyll-setup.md %}) as it works well
with Github-Pages and is free to use/host. This website also uses posts (as pages) sorted
by date updated, but is static and does not show the date created.

Some of the projects I have worked on:<br />
[Weather Station](https://github.com/mwyoung/Weather-Station)<br />
[Avr Serial Setup](https://github.com/mwyoung/avr-serial-test)<br />
[PCB Ruler](https://github.com/mwyoung/Adafruit-PCB-Ruler)<br />
[LED Cube](https://github.com/mwyoung/LED-Cube)<br />
