This is a personal website for sharing [projects]({% link posts.html %}) and providing a
source to remember where to find information.

This website was built using [jekyll]({% link _posts/2019-09-01-jekyll-setup.md %}) as it
works well with Github-Pages, and is free to use/host. This website also uses posts sorted
by date updated, and has a static set of pages instead of a blog with individual days used
for each post.

Some of the projects I have worked on:<br />
[Weather Station](https://github.com/mwyoung/Weather-Station)<br />
[Avr Serial Setup](https://github.com/mwyoung/avr-serial-test)<br />
[PCB Ruler](https://github.com/mwyoung/Adafruit-PCB-Ruler)<br />
[LED Cube](https://github.com/mwyoung/LED-Cube)<br />
