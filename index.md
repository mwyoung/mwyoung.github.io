This is a personal website for sharing [projects]({{ '/pages/' | relative_url }}) and
providing a source to remember where to find information.

This website was built using [jekyll]({% link _pages/jekyll-setup.md %}) as it works well
with Github-Pages and is free to use/host. This website also uses posts (as pages) sorted
by date updated, but is static and does not show the date created.

Some of the projects I have worked on include a [Weather
Station](https://github.com/mwyoung/Weather-Station), an [Avr Serial
Setup](https://github.com/mwyoung/avr-serial-test) for programming 328 microcontrollers, a
[PCB Ruler](https://github.com/mwyoung/Adafruit-PCB-Ruler) for having a physical
representation for parts, and a [LED Cube](https://github.com/mwyoung/LED-Cube).
